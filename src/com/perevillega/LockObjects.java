/**
 * The biggest advantage of Lock objects over implicit locks (synch methods or blocks) is their ability to back out
 * of an attempt to acquire a lock.
 * The tryLock method backs out if the lock is not available immediately or before a timeout expires (if specified).
 * The lockInterruptibly method backs out if another thread sends an interrupt before the lock is acquired.
